I decided to do another on nighter with Sara down at Cape Disappointment state park in southern washington on the coast. The views were amazing - especially the sunset on the first evening, which had the most incredible color spectrum. The van setup worked soo much better as well - still a couple of things to optimize, but we were much more comfortable</p>\n<p>Here are some pictures and videos from the sunset on the first day:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/sara-and-sunset1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/sara-and-sunset2.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/sara-and-sunset3.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/sara-and-sunset4.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/sunset-alone.jpg\"></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-6noWr4f6A\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UULsLENrqAE\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LqwLYaM-wk\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/01/cape-disappointment/bunker.jpg\"></p>\n<p>We stayed in the van that night - hand full of optimizations I figured were mostly around where to put things so they weren’t in the way. Removing the second bucket chair was super helpful - there was tons of space under the floor to store things like kitchen gear, car stuff, vaccum, and electronics. I also started storing clothes under Sara’s seat, which is great for the day and it’s easy enough to move to the front seat when it’s time to go to sleep at night. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the foam mattress was and at how much length we had in the van - Oakley (our dog) was not up in our space at all. It will be tight when Angela comes along, but do-able.

Worth a trip back at some point (maybe post pandemic) where we could ride along the beach/town and stop to play and/or stop for food at the restraunts in town.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/19/leadbetter-dissapointment-millersvania/discovery-trail1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/19/leadbetter-dissapointment-millersvania/discovery-trail2.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/01/19/leadbetter-dissapointment-millersvania/sara-playing-on-beach.jpg\"></p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rW-hUJJUlvs\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBKmZYbSWmU\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Our last state park was Millersvania. Unfortunately, my phone died in the middle of our hike so I didn’t get a map of the track we did. The park was relatively small, but there was a super fun beach area with swimming/boating/restraunt/bar right near a lake - which was all closed in the winter but looked like it would be super fun in summer. Definitely an area to go back to in the summer with our kayak or paddleboards.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-Nz3auhUY8\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xw-MEET34eM\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgHMpfzu7vA\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n"},{"title":"Seattle Snow Day","date":"2021-02-14T21:43:30.000Z","_content":"\nSo - we were planning to go on a van trip this weekend, but woke up on Thursday morning to this:\n\n![Morning Snow!](morning1.jpg)\n\n![Morning Snow!](morning2.jpg)\n\n![Morning Snow!](morning3.jpg)\n\n![Morning Snow!](morning4.jpg)\n\n![Morning Snow!](morning5.jpg)\n\nSnow!!

The trail was a bit over a mile and it had a bunch of intersting things to see.

The first thing we did once we arrived at camp is to go on a quick hike and have some food.\n\n![Hiking around camp](hiking1.jpg)\n\n![Hiking around camp](hiking2.jpg)\n\n![Mexican for Lunch](mexican_for_lunch.jpg)\n\nAfter our quick hike, we walked down to the beach to do our first kayaking trip. After remembering how to setup the kayak and pump it up, I realized my mistake - can you guess what it is?\n\n![Oops!](oops_paddle.jpg)\n\nThat's right, I brought two right paddles so the two paddles didn't fit together. But we didn't let that stop us - I just pinched the two paddles together at the grip and paddled away.

Great question. That’s what this blog post seeks to answer. Two primary reasons and a handful of secondary (nice to have) reasons. I’ll start with the standard pro/con analysis. Let me start off with my requirements</p>\n<p>The first question I had to answer was whether I wanted a compact/minivan vs a full sized sprinter van. For me, I decided to optimize for a perfect 3-4 day expedition vs a full time live onboard. This meant I didn’t need as much space and I could avoid the full size van - making it easier to drive in the city, better gas millage and allow it to be quite a bit cheaper. Cons are less space (obviously) and you can’t stand up inside. If I start looking at month long trips in the future (if my work situation changes) then I would reconsider. The rest of this post focuses on the mini/compact vans vs full sized vans.</p>\n<p>Pros:<br>    1. <strong>2nd Row stow and go seats</strong> - this was critical for me. It meant I could have a car seat for my daughter in the second row and sleep comfortably in the whole van.<br>    2. <strong>Big enough to hold a piece of plywood with seats down</strong> - This was important to me becuase I could use the van for other things, but it also meant that there would be ample room to stretch out when sleeping.<br>    3. Doesn’t require massive conversion work - This was a pro for me that I didn’t have to spend a bunch of time converting the van right away. I could use it from day 1 and start customizing it over time.</p>\n<p>Cons:<br>    1. More expensive than other minivans - while this was a con, it was still cheaper that a custom campervan conversion from a company that specializes in that sort of thing.<br>    2. Looks like a minivan (as opposed to a camper van). Other options looked a bit more commercial/campery.</p>\n<p>I found two videos of folks that converted their chrysler pasifica into a camper van. Neither was quite what I wanted, but they showed some of the options I could pursue.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKZ0AGtu1fc\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>I like this build more than the next one, but it’s designed for one instead of 2-3 (like mine will need to be). I liked the seat in the back where he could stretch out his legs and I liked the minimal kitchen setup (sink &amp; refrig). I would do a bit more cooking than he does I think, but I think I would want to do that on a separate table rather than in the car (to avoid fumes).</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7qqPp_-yDs\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>I like that it was convertable back into a van when they were done. I also liked the electrical setup they had going. I didn’t like the T setup in the back and likely wouldn’t want a microwave in mine. There is something interesting about having storage up above where your feet go - saves space that you wouldn’t have otherwise used.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Runners-up\"><a href=\"#Runners-up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Runners up:\"></a>Runners up:</h3><ol>\n<li>Dodge Grand Caravan<ul>\n<li>Pros: A bit cheaper than grand caravan</li>\n<li>Cons: Discontinued</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nisan NV200/Ford Transit connect<ul>\n<li>Pros: Would have been a more traditional camper van - start with cargo van and convert into full camper van</li>\n<li>Cons: Wouldn’t have been able to use it right away.

This was our first big van trip - and part of a bigger vacation. In all, we travelled 1400 miles over 5 days and saw some really interesting sights - and learned some new tricks for longer van trips & van trips in hot weather. I'm going to write this trip up in 3 blog posts - this one covers the road trip there and the other two will cover the backpacking trip we went on and touring around Yellowstone national park.\n\nOur trip started off uneventfully - we had a ~4 hour 30 min drive to Lewis and Clark Trail state park. The park was fun - great campsite and a fun trail called the \"Fur Fins and Feathers\" trail - named because it went by a river, through a forest canopy full of birds, and had virually no furry animals to speak of :).

We dedided to walk around a bit and soon realized that Mosquitoes really owned this park. Sara and I did ok, but Angela was attacked and we had to retreat to the van.

Temperatures across Washington and Idaho become unbearable - 108 degrees in some places - so we decided to do some longer days and get home more quickly as Seattle was back down into the 70s at that point. This made for long days, but we still managed to stop and have a bit of fun. Our one night was in Baker city - a historic town with a fun vibe.

This was our first big van trip - and part of a bigger vacation. In all, we travelled 1400 miles over 5 days and saw some really interesting sights - and learned some new tricks for longer van trips &amp; van trips in hot weather. I’m going to write this trip up in 3 blog posts - this one covers the road trip there and the other two will cover the backpacking trip we went on and touring around Yellowstone national park.</p>\n<p>Our trip started off uneventfully - we had a ~4 hour 30 min drive to Lewis and Clark Trail state park. The park was fun - great campsite and a fun trail called the “Fur Fins and Feathers” trail - named because it went by a river, through a forest canopy full of birds, and had virually no furry animals to speak of :). Still it was a blast and Sara had a great time.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/small_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/small_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/small_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/small_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/small_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail5.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Fur Fins and Feathers</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/tiny_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/tiny_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/tiny_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/tiny_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/tiny_fur_fins_and_feathers_trail5.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>We were off to a great start on the trip reports, but we failed on every other day of the roadtrip.</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekC1zJJkid0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>The second day/night was more eventful. There was a bit longer drive (~6 hours) but some fun stops along the way - including blueberry picking at a roadside farm. We arrived at Bruneau sand dunes state park around 2 pm and it was hot. We dedided to walk around a bit and soon realized that Mosquitoes really owned this park. Sara and I did ok, but Angela was attacked and we had to retreat to the van. It was a hot night and none of us got a ton of sleep - still, we remained in good spirits and proceeded on to Yellowstone the next day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/picking_blueberries.jpg\" alt=\"Picking Blueberries\"></p>\n<p>Sara also made some new friends and walked over to introduce herself all on her own (the draw of a inflatable pool and pool toys was too great).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/sara_playing_with_neighbors.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting the Neighbors\"></p>\n<p>Then we went on our walk down to the observatory and apitheater - and then promply ran away from the Mosquitoes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/walk_at_sanddunes.jpg\" alt=\"Walk at Sanddunes\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/17/yellowstone-road-trip/running_from_mosquitoes.jpg\" alt=\"Running from Mosquitoes!\"></p>\n<p>Depite the heat, it was an amazing place to walk around and play.

Temperatures across Washington and Idaho become unbearable - 108 degrees in some places - so we decided to do some longer days and get home more quickly as Seattle was back down into the 70s at that point. This made for long days, but we still managed to stop and have a bit of fun. Our one night was in Baker city - a historic town with a fun vibe.

I think it took a couple of days to sink in, so her reaction was a bit mutted.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_mamoth_terrace.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_travertine1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_travertine2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_travertine3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_travertine4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_travertine5.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Travertine</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_mamoth_terrace.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_travertine1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_travertine2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_travertine3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_travertine4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_travertine5.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>Next we headed to the Lamar Valley for wildlife viewing and a short day hike. We were rewarded by tons of bison, a coyote (probably not a wolf, but there was some debate there, and lots of birds/ground squirels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/Bison.jpg\" alt=\"Bison\"></p>\n<p>We saw this injured Coyote from the road limping along. There was some debate about how it might be a wolf - but the facial structure and ears were most likely a coyote. Pretty cool to see, but sad to see the injury - definitely reminds you of how challenging the wild can be for animals…</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFNusWjupyY\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Next was our Lamar Valley day hike, which included a minor Bison Stampede! As near as we could tell, they just got going down the hill and as soon as one of them started running the rest joined in. We got to the top of the rise, and they were clearly not being chased by anything. This valley was amazingly beautiful and I would love to go back at some point and do a longer/multiday trip into the valley. So much wildlife and you could just tell that it got more amazing (and remote) the further up the valley you went.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike10.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike11.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike12.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike13.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Lamar Valley Hike</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike10.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike11.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike12.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike13.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>Bison Stampede!</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aMG9ImZPZw\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Sara was quite the hiker - and hit a brick wall when she got back to the car. :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/asleep_after_hike.jpg\" alt=\"Asleep After Hike\"></p>\n<p>We left on our backpacking trip the next day (which will be my third and final post in this series).

That being said, we got some great pictures and moved along. Right as we were leaving, the Park Rangers showed up and cleared people out. We have a “Bear Jam” was the radio call. When we drove by later, they had the whole area coned off and weren’t letting people anywhere near the area - probably so that the bear didn’t get too used to people being around. The bear also had a radio collar in the pictures - so he was being tracked.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div

As near as we could tell, they just got going down the hill and as soon as one of them started running the rest joined in. We got to the top of the rise, and they were clearly not being chased by anything. This valley was amazingly beautiful and I would love to go back at some point and do a longer/multiday trip into the valley. So much wildlife and you could just tell that it got more amazing (and remote) the further up the valley you went.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike10.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike11.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike12.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike13.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/small_lamar_valley_hike9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Lamar Valley Hike</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike10.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike11.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike12.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike13.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/tiny_lamar_valley_hike9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>Bison Stampede!</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aMG9ImZPZw\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Sara was quite the hiker - and hit a brick wall when she got back to the car. :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/06/23/yellowstone-touring-around/asleep_after_hike.jpg\" alt=\"Asleep After Hike\"></p>\n<p>We left on our backpacking trip the next day (which will be my third and final post in this series).

When we drove by later, they had the whole area coned off and weren’t letting people anywhere near the area - probably so that the bear didn’t get too used to people being around.

What an amazing trip it was... We went to a pretty remote part of the park which actually crossed out of the national park and into the national forest twice during the trip. We saw some wildlife, some of it got a little two close, and we saw some amazing scenery, flowers, animal sign, and most importantly - we found the remoteness that recharges me. Sara was with her grandparents for this one, so it was just Angela and I.\n\nOur trip had an interesting start - we couldn't find the trail head. We realized later that the trailhead had moved up the canyon a bit from where it was shown on the map, but at the time it looked like we had found the trailhead. Until we found a sign that said private property no trespassing. Ended up adding like a mile and a half onto our trip, but we eventually found the real trailhead and got started.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/YhEAL5YZrh1HHBuFJ2W7yeAQ?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n{% gallery \"False Start\"\n  false_start1.jpg\n  false_start2.jpg\n%}\n\nThe rest of day one went much better. We hiked down a steep canyon to the yellowstone river and hiked along the river for 9 miles. The first half of the day was very dry/dusty with small shrubs but it got progressivly more forested as we went along. Our campsite that night was by a river bed in a fairly thick forest, beautiful to look at but we quickly realized that mosquitoes were going to be a problem on this trip. We cooked dinner quickly, cleaned up in the river, and headed into the bug free zone in the tent.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HRdvCQgkc8pDIIjCxvKuDjjh?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n![Start The Hike](start_the_hike.jpg)\n\n{% gallery \"Day One\"\n  day_one1.jpg\n  day_one2.jpg\n  day_one3.jpg\n  day_one4.jpg\n  day_one5.jpg\n  day_one6.jpg\n  day_one7.jpg\n  day_one8.jpg\n  day_one9.jpg\n  day_one10.jpg\n  day_one11.jpg\n  day_one12.jpg\n  day_one13.jpg\n  day_one14.jpg\n  day_one15.jpg\n  day_one16.jpg\n  day_one17.jpg\n  day_one18.jpg\n  day_one19.jpg\n  day_one20.jpg\n  day_one21.jpg\n  day_one22.jpg\n  day_one23.jpg\n  day_one24.jpg\n  day_one25.jpg\n  day_one26.jpg\n%}\n\nDay 2 started early, but not super early. We got up just as the sun was coming up and knew we were on borrowed time before the bugs came in. We packed quickly, had breakfast, and loaded up for the day. We had a little over 10 miles to go today, but it followed the river and then the creek so it wasn't very steep or challenging terrain. About 2 hours into the hike we came to a big open meadow at the top of a draw and we found the worst mosquitoes of the trip. They bit me straight through my shirt and I realized that my sunshirt wasn't going to cut it - I didn't figure it out until the next day but my rain jacked ended up being the most effective way of keeping them out (although it was hot!). We turned up hellroaring canyon that afternoon and camped at the last campsite inside the national park before the national forest boundary. Our camp was fun and we could have a fire which allowed us to burn some of our food trash and keep the mosquitoes at bay (at least for a little while). We went on an expidition to find new flowers for Angela and we ended up finding some wild onion which we picked to spice up our backpacker meal. A yellow bellied marmot also wondered into camp and scurried about around our tent for a couple of hours before bed.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/u22byPkjv7Xnm3sEqnn4AyXk?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n{% gallery \"Day Two\"\n  day_two1.jpg\n  day_two2.jpg\n  day_two3.jpg\n  day_two4.jpg\n  day_two5.jpg\n  day_two6.jpg\n  day_two7.jpg\n  day_two8.jpg\n  day_two9.jpg\n  scat1.jpg\n  day_two10.jpg\n  day_two11.jpg\n  day_two12.jpg\n  day_two13.jpg\n  day_two14.jpg\n  day_two15.jpg\n  day_two16.jpg\n%}\n\nWe saw this very cool golden bird in a big meadow near a small lake.

We left early (before sunrise) because we knew it was going to be our hardest day at 13 miles with a bunch of elevation gain - but the route we were on would have ended up being closer to 16 had we followed it. Instead, we decided to camp in the national forest just outside the park and skip the poachers trail to the buffalo plateau. This meant we were going to come back along the coyote creek trail instead of the buffalo plateau trail. In retrospect, I did my distance calculations based on laying waypoints along the trail which meant it didn't include all of the switchbacks, etc. Over the course of the entire route, this ended up cuting around 3 miles off of the trail. Next time, Looking up the trail names online can get you the exact distance of the trail and I should have done that. [Hiking Project](https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7015048/poachers-trail) (amongst other sites) has trail details that allow you to see how long the trail is which could have helped us avoid that. Angela left the planning up to me for this trip as well and she committed to being more involved in the next one as a second set of eyes. This was, however, the most beautiful camp we stayed at. It was pearched up on a hill a little ways from the creek and the view into the valley (especially during the sunset) was amazing. Because we were a little ways from the creek the mosquitoes weren't as bad at first so we had a couple of hours of reprive before the sun set and they made it up the hill.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HwssVXwgA3oo95ZsvNsSCHdY?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n{% gallery \"Day Three\"\n  day_three1.jpg\n  day_three10.jpg\n  day_three11.jpg\n  day_three12.jpg\n  day_three2.jpg\n  day_three3.jpg\n  day_three4.jpg\n  day_three5.jpg\n  day_three6.jpg\n  day_three7.jpg\n  day_three8.jpg\n  day_three9.jpg\n%}\n\nThis was also the day with the most wildlife.

Certainly startled Angela, but we remembered the training they give you before you head off into the back country and stood our ground and made a bunch of noise. The bear saw us and, unlike any other bear encouters I have had, just meandered towards us down the trail. Usually bears either run off when they hear you or they just stay put and ignore you. I got a couple of pictures before I decided it was time to get out the bear spray. He approach to about 20 feet and I fired the bear spray once - turns out the range on bear spray isn't great and the instructions you get (start spraying at about 30 feet) are a bit missleading. So I waited until he was about 15 feet (right at the edge of the range) and sprayed again. I didn't 'hit' him necessarily, but he could start to smell it and he stopped. He was close enough at this point that I could see a scar on his face and his shoulder. He hung out for 30 secs or so and then decided to head up the hill of the trail. He went up about 30 feet and then went around us and back down onto the trail. We hurried forward and left him behind. Despite the fact that the bear seemed relatively uneffected by the bear spray, walking back through the area I sprayed and getting some of it blown back at my from the slight breeze was potent and we were tearing up/coughing for the next 15 min or so - really cleared out the sinuses!\n\n{% gallery \"Bear\"\n  bear1.jpg\n  bear2.jpg\n  bear3.jpg\n%}\n\nDay 4 was much less eventful. We got up a bit later because we knew the hike was all downhill (until the very end) and we wanted to have some time in the morning to hydrate before we started the day. It was a beatiful hike down Coyote creek and back into Hellroaring canyon. From there, we hiked down the long wide valley to the suspension bridge over the yellowston river. From there it as a steep, short hike up to the Hellroaring trailhead where our van was waiting for us (we pre-positioned it there before we started the hike.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/lJJ9f7X1ct19rot7o5cdIYfL?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n{% gallery \"Day Four\"\n  day_four1.jpg\n  day_four2.jpg\n  day_four3.jpg\n  day_four4.jpg\n  day_four5.jpg\n  day_four6.jpg\n  day_four7.jpg\n  day_four8.jpg\n  day_four9.jpg\n%}\n\nWe saw a bunch of bones throughout the hike, here is a quick assortement of mostly elk but probably some deer bones as well.\n\n{% gallery \"Bones\"\n  bones1.jpg\n  bones2.jpg\n  bones3.jpg\n%}\n\nWe saw a mule train coming down the hill on the last half mile of the trail.

Some lessons learned were to always bring my zip off pants instead of just shorts (for bug protection) and some camp shoes that cover your feet (instead of Sandals) would have been nice.

We also had really bad headaches on day 3 - I think both of us were un-used to how much water you need to drink in this dry climate and were a bit dehydrated.

What an amazing trip it was... We went to a pretty remote part of the park which actually crossed out of the national park and into the national forest twice during the trip. We saw some wildlife, some of it got a little two close, and we saw some amazing scenery, flowers, animal sign, and most importantly - we found the remoteness that recharges me.

We realized later that the trailhead had moved up the canyon a bit from where it was shown on the map, but at the time it looked like we had found the trailhead. Until we found a sign that said private property no trespassing. Ended up adding like a mile and a half onto our trip, but we eventually found the real trailhead and got started.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/YhEAL5YZrh1HHBuFJ2W7yeAQ?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n{% gallery \"False Start\"\n  false_start1.jpg\n  false_start2.jpg\n%}\n\nThe rest of day one went much better. We hiked down a steep canyon to the yellowstone river and hiked along the river for 9 miles. The first half of the day was very dry/dusty with small shrubs but it got progressivly more forested as we went along. Our campsite that night was by a river bed in a fairly thick forest, beautiful to look at but we quickly realized that mosquitoes were going to be a problem on this trip. We cooked dinner quickly, cleaned up in the river, and headed into the bug free zone in the tent.\n\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HRdvCQgkc8pDIIjCxvKuDjjh?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n![Start The Hike](start_the_hike.jpg)\n\n{% gallery \"Day One\"\n  day_one1.jpg\n  day_one2.jpg\n  day_one3.jpg\n  day_one4.jpg\n  day_one5.jpg\n  day_one6.jpg\n  day_one7.jpg\n  day_one8.jpg\n  day_one9.jpg\n  day_one10.jpg\n  day_one11.jpg\n  day_one12.jpg\n  day_one13.jpg\n  day_one14.jpg\n  day_one15.jpg\n  day_one16.jpg\n  day_one17.jpg\n  day_one18.jpg\n  day_one19.jpg\n  day_one20.jpg\n  day_one21.jpg\n  day_one22.jpg\n  day_one23.jpg\n  day_one24.jpg\n  day_one25.jpg\n  day_one26.jpg\n%}\n\nDay 2 started early, but not super early.

We got up just as the sun was coming up and knew we were on borrowed time before the bugs came in. We packed quickly, had breakfast, and loaded up for the day. We had a little over 10 miles to go today, but it followed the river and then the creek so it wasn’t very steep or challenging terrain. About 2 hours into the hike we came to a big open meadow at the top of a draw and we found the worst mosquitoes of the trip. They bit me straight through my shirt and I realized that my sunshirt wasn’t going to cut it - I didn’t figure it out until the next day but my rain jacked ended up being the most effective way of keeping them out (although it was hot!). We turned up hellroaring canyon that afternoon and camped at the last campsite inside the national park before the national forest boundary. Our camp was fun and we could have a fire which allowed us to burn some of our food trash and keep the mosquitoes at bay (at least for a little while). We went on an expidition to find new flowers for Angela and we ended up finding some wild onion which we picked to spice up our backpacker meal. A yellow bellied marmot also wondered into camp and scurried about around our tent for a couple of hours before bed.</p>\n<iframe

The picture doesn’t do it justice, but it was a very cool looking bird. We looked it up in our guide and we think it was an American goldfinch. They only have this bright plumage for a couple of months in the summer, so it was a treat to see him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/golden_bird.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Bird\"></p>\n<p>Some pictures from our flower finding expedition.

I have alwasy aspired to forage for food on these trips and suplementing the meals we carry was very exciting for me.

Definitely helped the meal and the onions were very tasty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/wild_onion.jpg\" alt=\"Wild Onion\"></p>\n<p>This little guy came into our camp just before sunset (while we were sheltering from the bugs).

We left early (before sunrise) because we knew it was going to be our hardest day at 13 miles with a bunch of elevation gain - but the route we were on would have ended up being closer to 16 had we followed it. Instead, we decided to camp in the national forest just outside the park and skip the poachers trail to the buffalo plateau. This meant we were going to come back along the coyote creek trail instead of the buffalo plateau trail. In retrospect, I did my distance calculations based on laying waypoints along the trail which meant it didn’t include all of the switchbacks, etc. Over the course of the entire route, this ended up cuting around 3 miles off of the trail. Next time, Looking up the trail names online can get you the exact distance of the trail and I should have done that. <a href=\"https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7015048/poachers-trail\">Hiking Project</a> (amongst other sites) has trail details that allow you to see how long the trail is which could have helped us avoid that. Angela left the planning up to me for this trip as well and she committed to being more involved in the next one as a second set of eyes. This was, however, the most beautiful camp we stayed at. It was pearched up on a hill a little ways from the creek and the view into the valley (especially during the sunset) was amazing. Because we were a little ways from the creek the mosquitoes weren’t as bad at first so we had a couple of hours of reprive before the sun set and they made it up the hill.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HwssVXwgA3oo95ZsvNsSCHdY?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three10.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three11.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three12.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Day Three</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three10.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three11.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three12.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>This was also the day with the most wildlife.

Certainly startled Angela, but we remembered the training they give you before you head off into the back country and stood our ground and made a bunch of noise. The bear saw us and, unlike any other bear encouters I have had, just meandered towards us down the trail. Usually bears either run off when they hear you or they just stay put and ignore you. I got a couple of pictures before I decided it was time to get out the bear spray. He approach to about 20 feet and I fired the bear spray once - turns out the range on bear spray isn’t great and the instructions you get (start spraying at about 30 feet) are a bit missleading. So I waited until he was about 15 feet (right at the edge of the range) and sprayed again. I didn’t ‘hit’ him necessarily, but he could start to smell it and he stopped. He was close enough at this point that I could see a scar on his face and his shoulder. He hung out for 30 secs or so and then decided to head up the hill of the trail. He went up about 30 feet and then went around us and back down onto the trail. We hurried forward and left him behind. Despite the fact that the bear seemed relatively uneffected by the bear spray, walking back through the area I sprayed and getting some of it blown back at my from the slight breeze was potent and we were tearing up/coughing for the next 15 min or so - really cleared out the sinuses!</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear3.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Bear</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear3.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>Day 4 was much less eventful. We got up a bit later because we knew the hike was all downhill (until the very end) and we wanted to have some time in the morning to hydrate before we started the day. It was a beatiful hike down Coyote creek and back into Hellroaring canyon. From there, we hiked down the long wide valley to the suspension bridge over the yellowston river. From there it as a steep, short hike up to the Hellroaring trailhead where our van was waiting for us (we pre-positioned it there before we started the hike.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/lJJ9f7X1ct19rot7o5cdIYfL?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Day Four</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>We saw a bunch of bones throughout the hike, here is a quick assortement of mostly elk but probably some deer bones as well.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones3.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Bones</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones3.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>We saw a mule train coming down the hill on the last half mile of the trail.

Some lessons learned were to always bring my zip off pants instead of just shorts (for bug protection) and some camp shoes that cover your feet (instead of Sandals) would have been nice. Also room for improvement on the route planning front on day 3. We also had really bad headaches on day 3 - I think both of us were un-used to how much water you need to drink in this dry climate and were a bit dehydrated. We drank a lot in the evening and felt better on day 4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/final_glance.jpg\" alt=\"Final Glance back at the route we just hiked\"></p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p>Backpacking Trip Report</p>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yYVvnKkIgKE\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n<p>The third (and final) installment of our Yellowstone trip was the backpacking trip. What an amazing trip it was… We went to a pretty remote part of the park which actually crossed out of the national park and into the national forest twice during the trip. We saw some wildlife, some of it got a little two close, and we saw some amazing scenery, flowers, animal sign, and most importantly - we found the remoteness that recharges me. Sara was with her grandparents for this one, so it was just Angela and I.</p>\n<p>Our trip had an interesting start - we couldn’t find the trail head. We realized later that the trailhead had moved up the canyon a bit from where it was shown on the map, but at the time it looked like we had found the trailhead. Until we found a sign that said private property no trespassing. Ended up adding like a mile and a half onto our trip, but we eventually found the real trailhead and got started.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/YhEAL5YZrh1HHBuFJ2W7yeAQ?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_false_start1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_false_start2.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">False Start</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_false_start1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_false_start2.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>The rest of day one went much better. We hiked down a steep canyon to the yellowstone river and hiked along the river for 9 miles. The first half of the day was very dry/dusty with small shrubs but it got progressivly more forested as we went along. Our campsite that night was by a river bed in a fairly thick forest, beautiful to look at but we quickly realized that mosquitoes were going to be a problem on this trip. We cooked dinner quickly, cleaned up in the river, and headed into the bug free zone in the tent.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HRdvCQgkc8pDIIjCxvKuDjjh?embed=True'

We got up just as the sun was coming up and knew we were on borrowed time before the bugs came in. We packed quickly, had breakfast, and loaded up for the day. We had a little over 10 miles to go today, but it followed the river and then the creek so it wasn’t very steep or challenging terrain. About 2 hours into the hike we came to a big open meadow at the top of a draw and we found the worst mosquitoes of the trip. They bit me straight through my shirt and I realized that my sunshirt wasn’t going to cut it - I didn’t figure it out until the next day but my rain jacked ended up being the most effective way of keeping them out (although it was hot!). We turned up hellroaring canyon that afternoon and camped at the last campsite inside the national park before the national forest boundary. Our camp was fun and we could have a fire which allowed us to burn some of our food trash and keep the mosquitoes at bay (at least for a little while). We went on an expidition to find new flowers for Angela and we ended up finding some wild onion which we picked to spice up our backpacker meal. A yellow bellied marmot also wondered into camp and scurried about around our tent for a couple of hours before bed.</p>\n<iframe

We left early (before sunrise) because we knew it was going to be our hardest day at 13 miles with a bunch of elevation gain - but the route we were on would have ended up being closer to 16 had we followed it. Instead, we decided to camp in the national forest just outside the park and skip the poachers trail to the buffalo plateau. This meant we were going to come back along the coyote creek trail instead of the buffalo plateau trail. In retrospect, I did my distance calculations based on laying waypoints along the trail which meant it didn’t include all of the switchbacks, etc. Over the course of the entire route, this ended up cuting around 3 miles off of the trail. Next time, Looking up the trail names online can get you the exact distance of the trail and I should have done that. <a href=\"https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7015048/poachers-trail\">Hiking Project</a> (amongst other sites) has trail details that allow you to see how long the trail is which could have helped us avoid that. Angela left the planning up to me for this trip as well and she committed to being more involved in the next one as a second set of eyes. This was, however, the most beautiful camp we stayed at. It was pearched up on a hill a little ways from the creek and the view into the valley (especially during the sunset) was amazing. Because we were a little ways from the creek the mosquitoes weren’t as bad at first so we had a couple of hours of reprive before the sun set and they made it up the hill.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/HwssVXwgA3oo95ZsvNsSCHdY?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three10.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three11.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three12.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_three9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Day Three</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three10.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three11.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three12.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_three9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>This was also the day with the most wildlife.

Certainly startled Angela, but we remembered the training they give you before you head off into the back country and stood our ground and made a bunch of noise. The bear saw us and, unlike any other bear encouters I have had, just meandered towards us down the trail. Usually bears either run off when they hear you or they just stay put and ignore you. I got a couple of pictures before I decided it was time to get out the bear spray. He approach to about 20 feet and I fired the bear spray once - turns out the range on bear spray isn’t great and the instructions you get (start spraying at about 30 feet) are a bit missleading. So I waited until he was about 15 feet (right at the edge of the range) and sprayed again. I didn’t ‘hit’ him necessarily, but he could start to smell it and he stopped. He was close enough at this point that I could see a scar on his face and his shoulder. He hung out for 30 secs or so and then decided to head up the hill of the trail. He went up about 30 feet and then went around us and back down onto the trail. We hurried forward and left him behind. Despite the fact that the bear seemed relatively uneffected by the bear spray, walking back through the area I sprayed and getting some of it blown back at my from the slight breeze was potent and we were tearing up/coughing for the next 15 min or so - really cleared out the sinuses!</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bear3.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Bear</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bear3.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>Day 4 was much less eventful. We got up a bit later because we knew the hike was all downhill (until the very end) and we wanted to have some time in the morning to hydrate before we started the day. It was a beatiful hike down Coyote creek and back into Hellroaring canyon. From there, we hiked down the long wide valley to the suspension bridge over the yellowston river. From there it as a steep, short hike up to the Hellroaring trailhead where our van was waiting for us (we pre-positioned it there before we started the hike.</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.gaiagps.com/public/lJJ9f7X1ct19rot7o5cdIYfL?embed=True' style='border:none; overflow-y: hidden; background-color:white; min-width: 320px; max-width:420px; width:100%; height: 420px;' scrolling='no' seamless='seamless'></iframe>\n\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four3.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four4.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four5.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four6.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four7.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four8.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_day_four9.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Day Four</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four3.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four4.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four5.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four6.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four7.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four8.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_day_four9.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>We saw a bunch of bones throughout the hike, here is a quick assortement of mostly elk but probably some deer bones as well.</p>\n<div id=\"mainCarousel\" class=\"carousel mb-4 w-10/12 max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones1.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones2.jpg\" /></div></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><div class=\"panzoom\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/small_bones3.jpg\" /></div></div></div><span class=\"caption\">Bones</span><div id=\"thumbCarousel\" class=\"carousel max-w-xl mx-auto\"><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones1.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones2.jpg\" /></div><div class=\"carousel__slide\"><img class=\"panzoom__content\" src=\"2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/tiny_bones3.jpg\" /></div></div>\n\n<p>We saw a mule train coming down the hill on the last half mile of the trail.

Some lessons learned were to always bring my zip off pants instead of just shorts (for bug protection) and some camp shoes that cover your feet (instead of Sandals) would have been nice. Also room for improvement on the route planning front on day 3. We also had really bad headaches on day 3 - I think both of us were un-used to how much water you need to drink in this dry climate and were a bit dehydrated. We drank a lot in the evening and felt better on day 4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2021/07/04/yellowstone-backpacking/final_glance.jpg\" alt=\"Final Glance back at the route we just
