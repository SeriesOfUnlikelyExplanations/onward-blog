So - we were planning to go on a van trip this weekend, but woke up on Thursday morning to this:

Snow!! Doesn't happen very often in Seattle. So that, combined with the van not really being setup for snow driving, meant we ended up staying in the city. But, that doesn't mean we couldn't have a bit of fun...

Some more snow during the day - ended up with probably 2 feet...

Sara, as it turns out, loves snow - primarily for eating however. She wanted us to store some, which lasted about 3 days. Here is is before it was consumed.

And then for excilleration - Here's a video I took skiing down Dravus - bit icy, but super fun!

Finally, we took a trip back to Bainbridge for the cross island hike again - since Angela wasn't able to do it last time. I love this trail, the second time through just validated how much I like it. :)
