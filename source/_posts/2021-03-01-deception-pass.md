![Deception Pass Hike](hiking4.jpg)

Our first Van trip as a family - and our first trip with a working battery... :) This was also our first trip with our new inflatable Kayak, which was **super** fun. Sara and I left early Saturday and got a campsite, bought some groceries, and went on a hike around the south side of deception pass. The hike had some amazing views and we were able to get some play time on the beach as well. Almost a 3 mile hike and Sara did about half of it on her own.

Sara loves watching the water - we sat in this spot for over 20 min looking at kelp floating past and keeping our eyes peeled for any animals (we didn't see anything).

About half way through the hike, while Sara was in the backpack, she started singing a song she made up about where animals live (in the ocean, in the zoo, in the aquarium). I tried to capture some of it.

We were rewarded with a beach to play on at the end of the hike, right before we made it back to camp. Sara had a blast.

We got back to camp in the mid afternoon and took a nap. After that, we made dinner and got a movie all setup to await Angela's arrival - she was working during the day and was supposed to get in in the late afternoon. She didn't end up arriving until after sunset due to traffic, but we got all situated and things were pretty comfortable. Big learnings from this trip were 1) I need an adapter so that I can power multilple things off the battery (like the electic blanket and the water heater) without needing to open the floor. Here's an ammusing picture of Sara "being cozy" before I got in to the van.

Early the next morning, we got up and made breakfast and drove to the boat launch to try out our new kayak. Inflating it was far simplier than I thought it would be, but we didn't realize we needed a separate deck cover - so paddling made us a bit wet. Despite that - using the kayak was amazing. It was only barely slower than a plastic or fiberglass kayak and it was super easy to haul around...

I took a quick video to show how easy the kayak moved through the water.

Last, but certainly not least. We paddled past this pier that looked like it was no longer in use. As we paddled closer, we found sea otters! It was super cute to see them in the wild and so up close. They didn't seem worried about us, probably because they could outrun us in a heartbeat, so we got some great views.
