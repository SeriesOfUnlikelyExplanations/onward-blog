We had soo much fun with kayaking the last trip, I decided we just have to see how much more amazing it can be in good weather. And we had a great trip! Sans a small mishap with the paddle :) Pictures say a thousand words, so here we go!

So - brief synopsis of the trip. We were planning to go to Joemma beach state park but we didn't leave early enough and the camp was full. We diverted and headed to Pemrose state park - and got the last campsite! Lesson learned here - start earlier in the morning now that the weather is getting better... The first thing we did once we arrived at camp is to go on a quick hike and have some food.

After our quick hike, we walked down to the beach to do our first kayaking trip. After remembering how to setup the kayak and pump it up, I realized my mistake - can you guess what it is?

That's right, I brought two right paddles so the two paddles didn't fit together. But we didn't let that stop us - I just pinched the two paddles together at the grip and paddled away. It was annoying and needed constant readjustment - but I paddled over a mile that way.

But don't worry, I didn't do all the paddling... Sara also helped!

Once paddling was over, it was back to camp and time to play! Sara and I discovered a new game - find the stuffy. Sara had an amazing time running all over camp trying to find where the stuffies were hidden and vice versa. Sara has a really hard time still not telling me where she hid it... :)

And then she decided she just couldn't go on... :)

The following morning, we made our way over to Kopachuck State Park which has no camping but access to the beach and a fun paddle over to an island - Cutts island state park. It was about 2 mi total - which is not super long but the paddle issue became progressively more annoying.

The island was super fun - totally overwridden with Canada geese which was really cool to see. They were actually pretty agressive as we made our way inland - but more on that later. First, we had an amazing landing spot and had a quick snack.

There was a little trail that went up and over the island - pretty steap but it looked fun. Right as we were getting to the top, a very mighty (and persnick) goose at the top of the hill who blocked our path - we stopped there, but there were some pretty cool views over the cliff.

And finally - selfie from the top of the island before we headed back and drove home.
