We just completed our first 3 day van trip - which was an all around success. We went to three different state parks and saw some very different terrain in each - super fun trip. Also figured out quite a few van optimizations, including how to watch movies and the best way to store clothes.

So our first park was Leadbetter state park which is on the very end of cape dissapointment. It's a wildlife perserve and we saw a ton of birds. I didn't realize until after we got back to the car that dogs were not allowed - so shame on me. The coolest stuff we saw was a stretch of beach where the tide had started cutting away at the land above the beach and caused a bunch of trees to fall and the dune grass north of the loop, which was a stunning view.

Our second state park was cape dissapointment. We had been here before just a couple of weeks ago, but we decided to hike a different route which took us to the beach instead of seeing forest/historical sites like we did last time. The beach was super fun and Sara had a blast playing in the sand. The discovery trail is fairly long (almost 10 miles) and it's paved the whole way - so the ideal mode of transportation would have been bikes. Worth a trip back at some point (maybe post pandemic) where we could ride along the beach/town and stop to play and/or stop for food at the restraunts in town.

Our last state park was Millersvania. Unfortunately, my phone died in the middle of our hike so I didn't get a map of the track we did. The park was relatively small, but there was a super fun beach area with swimming/boating/restraunt/bar right near a lake - which was all closed in the winter but looked like it would be super fun in summer. Definitely an area to go back to in the summer with our kayak or paddleboards.
