### Spoiler Alert!
I picked the Chrysler Pasifica.

Why you might ask? Great question. That's what this blog post seeks to answer. Two primary reasons and a handful of secondary (nice to have) reasons. I'll start with the standard pro/con analysis. Let me start off with my requirements

The first question I had to answer was whether I wanted a compact/minivan vs a full sized sprinter van. For me, I decided to optimize for a perfect 3-4 day expedition vs a full time live onboard. This meant I didn't need as much space and I could avoid the full size van - making it easier to drive in the city, better gas millage and allow it to be quite a bit cheaper. Cons are less space (obviously) and you can't stand up inside. If I start looking at month long trips in the future (if my work situation changes) then I would reconsider. The rest of this post focuses on the mini/compact vans vs full sized vans.

Pros:
    1. **2nd Row stow and go seats** - this was critical for me. It meant I could have a car seat for my daughter in the second row and sleep comfortably in the whole van.
    2. **Big enough to hold a piece of plywood with seats down** - This was important to me becuase I could use the van for other things, but it also meant that there would be ample room to stretch out when sleeping.
    3. Doesn't require massive conversion work - This was a pro for me that I didn't have to spend a bunch of time converting the van right away. I could use it from day 1 and start customizing it over time.

Cons:
    1. More expensive than other minivans - while this was a con, it was still cheaper that a custom campervan conversion from a company that specializes in that sort of thing.
    2. Looks like a minivan (as opposed to a camper van). Other options looked a bit more commercial/campery.


I found two videos of folks that converted their chrysler pasifica into a camper van. Neither was quite what I wanted, but they showed some of the options I could pursue.

I like this build more than the next one, but it's designed for one instead of 2-3 (like mine will need to be). I liked the seat in the back where he could stretch out his legs and I liked the minimal kitchen setup (sink & refrig). I would do a bit more cooking than he does I think, but I think I would want to do that on a separate table rather than in the car (to avoid fumes).

I like that it was convertable back into a van when they were done. I also liked the electrical setup they had going. I didn't like the T setup in the back and likely wouldn't want a microwave in mine. There is something interesting about having storage up above where your feet go - saves space that you wouldn't have otherwise used.

### Runners up:
1. Dodge Grand Caravan
    - Pros: A bit cheaper than grand caravan
    - Cons: Discontinued
2. Nisan NV200/Ford Transit connect
    - Pros: Would have been a more traditional camper van - start with cargo van and convert into full camper van
    - Cons: Wouldn't have been able to use it right away. Would have needed to install a seat for my daughter's carseat - likely wouldn't be as safe as a seat built into the van from the begining.
