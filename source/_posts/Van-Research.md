### Spoiler Alert!
I picked the Chrysler Pasifica.

Why you might ask? Great question. That's what this blog post seeks to answer. Two primary reasons and a handful of secondary (nice to have) reasons. I'll start with the standard pro/con analysis.

Pros:
    1. **2nd Row stow and go seats** - this was critical for me
    2. **Big enough to hold a piece of plywood with seats down** -


Cons:
    1. More expensive than other minivans - while this was a con, it was still cheaper that a custom campervan conversion from a company that specializes in that sort of thing.

### Runners up:
1. Dodge Grand Caravan
    - Pros: A bit cheaper than grand caravan
    - Cons: Discontinued
