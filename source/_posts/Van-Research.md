### Spoiler Alert!
I picked the Chrysler Pasifica.

Why you might ask? Great question. That's what this blog post seeks to answer. Two primary reasons and a handful of secondary (nice to have) reasons. I'll start with the standard pro/con analysis. Let me start off with my requirements

Pros:
    1. **2nd Row stow and go seats** - this was critical for me. It meant I could have a car seat for my daughter in the second row and sleep comfortably in the whole van.
    2. **Big enough to hold a piece of plywood with seats down** - This was important to me becuase I could use the van for other things, but it also meant that there would be ample room to stretch out when sleeping.
    3. Doesn't require massive conversion work - This was a pro for me that I didn't have to spend a bunch of time converting the van right away. I could use it from day 1 and start customizing it over time.

Cons:
    1. More expensive than other minivans - while this was a con, it was still cheaper that a custom campervan conversion from a company that specializes in that sort of thing.
    2. Looks like a minivan (as opposed to a camper van). Other options


I found two videos of folks that converted their chrysler pasifica into a camper van. Neither was quite what I wanted, but they showed some of the options I could pursue.

I like this build more than the next one, but it's designed for one instead of 2-3 (like mine will need to be).

### Runners up:
1. Dodge Grand Caravan
    - Pros: A bit cheaper than grand caravan
    - Cons: Discontinued
