We decided to do a day hike on Bainbridge Island and the trail was super cool so I decided to do a post about it. It's a 5 mile trail point to point that goes from one side of Bainbridge Island to the other. The first mile was on a road and the first half mile was not super fun (small sholder) but after that the hike was super fun. Old growth forests, open meadows with views, interesting landmarks, etc were all available. Angela dropped Sara and I off at one end and came to meet us at the other end (she was planning to hike in to meet us but got a little lost).

Here are some of the fun landmarks along the way:

Stacked stones about half way. People just seemed to want to stack stones on this big rock for people to come and see. Some of them were quite high.

This was an old outhouse along the trail. Not in use anymore, but the roof was super cool with the moss growing off of it. Graffiti was kinda gross, but fun to see otherwise.

And the route:

I forgot to start my tracker until 1.5 mi in, so the track above isn't complete.

Here are some pictures of us on the trail.
