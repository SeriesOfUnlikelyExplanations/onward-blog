We did it! First overnight van trip was completed on Dec 22-23. We (Sara and I) went to Wenachee state park and camped in the campground there. It got cold... Down to single digits and I didn't quite have the camping system optimized for that weather yet so it was a cold night for me! (Sara did fine, she just burrowed down in the middle of my sleeping bag).

We brought an air mattress since my foam mattress had not yet arrived so upgrading that will be immediately benificial. My next two priorities are to get window covers (I've read that they help hold in a lot of heat) and getting the house battery so we can run a heating blanket at night.

One good win was having a campchair for sara to sit on in the van. This helped me have the entire sofa (eg the back row of seats) to myself.
