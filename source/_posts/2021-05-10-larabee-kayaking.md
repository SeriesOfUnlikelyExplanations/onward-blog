Larabee state park round two in the last couple of months - this time with kayak. Derek came along as well - which was super fun for a change. In total, almost 7 miles of kayaking, playing on the beach, camping, movie watching, campfires, and games galore.

Here we are all ready to go:

And then the morning paddle - about 3 miles, but very choppy/rough seas. Made paddling any distance really hard... I didn't get a picture, but we saw some seals from up close - which was super fun - but Sara didn't seem super impressed. She was far more interested in the bubbles!

We started of hunting for sea creatures (Sara thought the bubbles were sea creatures).

Then it was time for some paddling. Sara was very helpful with her "paddle":

After a quick break for lunch, we headed back out for another paddle - closer to 4 miles this time, but the water was much calmer and easy to kayak in:

By the end of the paddle, someone was very tuckered out... :)

A successful day!

Also some great learning on battery usage - I finally used up the entire battery. It only took watching a movie and boiling water to make coffee in the morning. I may need to get a second battery once I install a water pump - but doing pretty well until then.
