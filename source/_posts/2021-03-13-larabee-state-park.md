Our first trip to Larabee state park - which is right on chuckanut bay near Bellingham. Beautiful location and lots of fun stuff to do. There are railroad tracks that run right through the park, which might be n issue for some people, but Sara and I did great (didn't wake up at all) and it was fun to watch the trains go back while we were playing around. We went on a fun hike and Sara hiked the most I have ever seen her do - almost 2.5 miles!

We left on Friday night and didn't get into camp until late (so I don't have any pictures), but early the next morning we went down to the water to soak up the views and play on the beach.

After some play time, we had a nice breakfast and started on our hike. We took a break after the first couple of miles to soak up the views.

Once we got going again, we saw these cool trees that were growing straight out of rocks. Not sure what kind of tree they are, but we saw probably a dozen of them.

After Saras amazing performance on the hike, we decided to go into Bellingham for a nice dinner. We were a bit messy, but we snuck in anyway... We had an amazing dinner and the view was spectacular.

Finally, we went back to camp and made a fire. Sara was playing by Oakley's bowl and she came back to hand me some soup! What a resourcefull little girl finding edibles and making a soup...

Upon closer inspection however, it turned out to be a soup made entirely of rocks. Still grateful, but somewhat less nourishing. :)
