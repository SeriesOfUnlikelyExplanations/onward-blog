So I decided to try to find something on the Olympic peninsula for this trip. I found an interesting camp near lake cushman with some trails nearby that looked like fun. Lake Cushman is a beautiful area with some amazing day sites right along the beach. Here are some pictures of the lake

You can see it in some of the photos below, but the water level was super low - which I suspect had to do with the snow we got and the melt overwelming the dam (Lake Cushman is man made). It was an erie sight at times with these fields of sandy stumps where the water used to be...

The trail was called Dry creek and it started off in this very unique neighborhood - with the trail going through folks backyards. Within a mile, it left the neighborhood and started heading up a valley (Dry Creek valley) and started gaining elevation until we were in quite a bit of snow.
