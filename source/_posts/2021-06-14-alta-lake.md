We went to Alta lake for the weekend, near lake Chelan - left Saturday morning and made the 3.5 hour drive up there. We had a great time, but it was a crowded little lake - very different from the lakes I have gone to in the past (when the weather wasn't as nice). The most exciting news though was that Angela came with us! It's the first time she has made an entire trip (she met us on Saturday night for the last one. This was the first trip with a working water system as well - which was super exciting. I now have 6 gallons of water (2 3-gal tanks) connected to a pump that we can use for dishes, cleaning ourselves, or drinking water.

When we arrived on Saturday, it was just a bit after noon. We started exploring round the lake and found swings and some beach area and a small shack with snacks/ice cream. We had to go swinging first and then we decided to take off on a hike. It was a beautiful trail, but it quickly started going straight up... It got pretty steap near the end with pretty big drop offs, we had to keep a close eye on Sara and hold her hand the whole second half. But it was worth it for the views at the end... :)

The water worked like a charm. It's controlled by these little RF remotes, so you can operate it without having to climb into the van. I didn't bring it on this trip, but I have a small shower tent that I'll show on the next video. For now, here it is working:

Angela did a much better job making the bed with the van in camper mode than I ever did. So good in fact, that I had to take a couple of pictures:

We watched a movie after dinner and everyone slept great The next morning we went kayaking (Sara and I did anyway - Angela wanted to identify flowers and took Oakley on a walk). We did a circumnavigation of the lake and saw tons of birds and plant life. We also saw horses - the end of the lake buts up against a pasture with a dozen or so horses in it.

We also saw this fun house that couldn't have been larger than a studio - all set right above a big boat garage. Clearly they have their priorities straight - boat first! :)

We stopped for lunch on the way home and saw this great quote that summed up our trip
