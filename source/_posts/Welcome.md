title: Welcome to my Blog
---

Welcome to the Always Onward blog. This blog is mostly going to be for me to cronicle my families adventures so that my daughter can read about all the fun we had - but also to share them with the world! Primarily, our adventures will include van travel (mostly weekend trips) and at some point, a full time sailing trip. So - here we are at the end of 2020, I am planning to buy my van in the next couple of weeks and a boat in the next 3-4 years. It will be fun to look back 3 years from now to see how much fun stuff we have done!

Footnote for some of the nerdy folks out there - This blog is being written in Hexo and served through S3/Cloudfront. Part of my goal here is to learn and become fluent in markdown. I'm also thinking about building a lambda that would allow user comments and a dynamic contact us experience.
