- Pemrose State park - 19 campsites. Near the beach and great paddling opportunities nearby. Nearby is Kopachuck State Park (includes Cutts island state park) - No camping. The park has a big beach and it's a quick paddle to Cutts island state park - a small island with lots of birds primarily Canada Geese.

- Larabee State Park - great campground near the railroad a the north end of Chuckanut bay. Great hiking nearby and would be a good paddling spot (I think) in good weather.
