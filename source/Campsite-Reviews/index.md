- Pemrose State park - 19 campsites. Near the beach and great paddling opportunities nearby. Nearby is Kopachuck State Park (includes Cutts island state park) - No camping. The park has a big beach and it's a quick paddle to Cutts island state park - a small island with lots of birds primarily Canada Geese.

- Larabee State Park - great campground near the railroad a the north end of Chuckanut bay. Great hiking nearby and would be a good paddling spot (I think) in good weather.

- Baker Lake - Great campsites right along the water - also good boondoggling in addition to campsites along the road on the way there. Fairly crowded in Summer, probably not super crowded in the Winter. No cell reception for the last 20 mi or so as you approach camp.

- Columbia river campsites - Bunch of campsites along the river near Wenachee. Wenatchee has great bike trails and winery's as well as state parks on the bike trails. Fun trip to do with bikes.
